# AssemblyMergeSort
Merge Sort algorithm written in a subset of ARM architecture called "LEG"



LEG Merge Sort Algorithm
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in LEG assembly language. LEG is a subset of the ARM architecture designed for educational purposes, and this implementation demonstrates the application of the Merge Sort algorithm using LEG assembly.

Introduction
Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts an array or a list. The algorithm works by dividing the input into smaller sub-arrays, recursively sorting each sub-array, and then merging them back together.

This LEG assembly implementation provides a clear example of how the Merge Sort algorithm can be expressed in the LEG architecture.

Performance
Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets. The performance of this LEG assembly implementation is influenced by the specific characteristics of the LEG architecture and the efficiency of the assembly code.
